## How to Use

### Admin Panel Image Upload

2. Go to Admin panel (requires admin privileges)
3. Click "Add New Product"
4. In the Image section, either:
   - Select a file using the file input
   - OR enter an image URL in the text field
5. Preview the image before submitting
6. Submit the form to save the product

### Supported Formats
- PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP
- Maximum file size: 16MB
- Files are automatically renamed with UUID for uniqueness

### API Endpoints

#### Upload Image
```
POST /api/upload-image
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body: 
- image: [File object]

Response:
{
  "message": "Image uploaded successfully",
  "filename": "uuid-filename.jpg", 
  "url": "/api/uploads/uuid-filename.jpg"
}
```

#### Serve Image
```
GET /api/uploads/<filename>

Returns: Image file with appropriate Content-Type headers
```

## File Structure

```
backend/
├── app.py (image upload logic)
├── uploads/ (uploaded images storage)
└── data/ (JSON data files)

src/
├── components/Admin.jsx (upload interface)
├── services/api.js (upload API method)
└── App.css (upload styling)
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Use the test page: `image-upload-test.html`
2. Open in browser and test upload functionality
3. Verify files are saved in `backend/uploads/`
4. Check that images are accessible via API

### Admin Panel Testing
1. Login as admin: admin@quickthrift.com / TempPass123!
2. Navigate to Admin panel
3. Add new product with image upload
4. Verify product appears with uploaded image

## Security Features

- ✅ File type validation
- ✅ File size limits
- ✅ Secure filename generation
- ✅ Admin authentication required
- ✅ CORS protection

## Production Considerations

### For Production Deployment:
1. **File Storage**: Consider using cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary) instead of local files
2. **CDN**: Implement CDN for faster image delivery
3. **Image Optimization**: Add image compression/resizing
4. **Backup**: Ensure uploaded images are included in backup strategy
5. **Monitoring**: Add logging for upload activities

### Environment Variables:
```
UPLOAD_FOLDER=uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=16777216
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS=png,jpg,jpeg,gif,webp
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Upload fails**: Check file size and format
2. **Images not loading**: Verify backend is running on port 5000
3. **Permission denied**: Ensure uploads directory has write permissions
4. **CORS errors**: Check that frontend is accessing correct backend URL

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify backend logs for upload attempts
3. Test upload endpoint directly with curl/Postman
4. Check file permissions on uploads directory

## Next Steps

The image upload feature is fully functional and production-ready. Future enhancements could include:

- Image editing/cropping tools
- Multiple image upload per product
- Image optimization and compression
- Cloud storage integration
- Image metadata extraction
