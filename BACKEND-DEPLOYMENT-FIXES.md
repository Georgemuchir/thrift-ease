# 🔧 Backend Deployment Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Render Configuration**
- ✅ Updated main branch to match dev with latest changes
- ✅ Render will now use backend-only configuration
- ✅ Removed frontend deployment from Render (Netlify handles this)

### 2. **CORS & Preflight Issues**
- ✅ Enhanced CORS configuration with explicit methods and headers
- ✅ Added OPTIONS preflight handler for cross-origin requests
- ✅ Included both Netlify and Render URLs in allowed origins

### 3. **API URL Configuration**
- ✅ Frontend configured to use Render backend in production
- ✅ Debug logging added to track API URL selection

## 🌐 Architecture:
- **Frontend**: Netlify (`https://thrift-ease.netlify.app`)
- **Backend**: Render (`https://thrift-ease-backend.onrender.com`)

## 🧪 Testing APIs:

### Health Check:
```bash
curl https://thrift-ease-backend.onrender.com/api/health
```

### Register Test:
```bash
curl -X POST https://thrift-ease-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123","firstName":"Test","lastName":"User"}'
```

### Login Test:
```bash
curl -X POST https://thrift-ease-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@quickthrift.com","password":"TempPass123!"}'
```

## 🚀 Expected Results:

After Render redeploys (5-10 minutes):
- ❌ No more 401 Unauthorized errors
- ❌ No more CORS preflight failures  
- ✅ Registration/login should work from Netlify
- ✅ All API calls properly routed to Render backend

## 📋 Next Steps:

1. **Wait for Render deployment** to complete (~5-10 minutes)
2. **Test health endpoint** directly in browser
3. **Try registration/login** from Netlify frontend
4. **Check browser console** for API URL debug logs

**Status**: 🔄 **DEPLOYING** - Render is rebuilding with fixes
